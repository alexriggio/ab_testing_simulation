# A Comprehensive Simulation of A/B Testing at a Company Similar to Airbnb

## Overview
This repository contains the `ab_testing_simulation.ipynb` notebook â€” a comprehensive simulation, crafted by ex-Airbnb Senior Data Scientist, [Stephanie Pancoast](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephaniepancoast/), focusing on the design and analysis of A/B tests in a work setting.

All hands-on case studies within this notebook were completed by [Alex Riggio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexriggio/) over a four-week period, under the guidance and expert instruction of Stephanie Pancoast.

## Data
The `data` folder houses all the CSV files used in the notebook. These files constitute the datasets necessary for conducting the A/B testing simulations.

## Notebook Contents
The `ab_testing_simulation.ipynb` notebook includes simulations of in-depth real-world examples covering:
- The Basics of A/B Testing
- Gotchas - How Things Can Go Awry
- Early Results - How to Check Safely
- Concurrent Tests
